# Runbook — invariant layer

GENERATED from SPEC.md. **Do not paraphrase and do not edit casually.**

Editing this layer changes `invariant_hash`, which the Driver reads as a proposed amendment
to the method itself and escalates (`method_amendment_proposed`). That is the intended way
to promote a rule learned here into the spec — it is a signal, not a violation.

Target-specific procedure belongs in the target layer, never here.

`Status here` starts at `inherited, unexercised` for every rule. Update it to
`exercised at unit #N` the first time the rule actually bears on the work. Rules still
unexercised after N units are the P4 report: inherited, never tested against this target.

## Principles

### P1 — State lives on disk, not in context
**Implements:** P1
**Origin:** SPEC.md §3 (method)
**Status here:** inherited, unexercised

### P2 — The loop body is mechanical
**Implements:** P2
**Origin:** SPEC.md §3 (method)
**Status here:** inherited, unexercised

### P3 — A green result must be able to name what it compared, and be able to go red
**Implements:** P3
**Origin:** SPEC.md §3 (method)
**Status here:** inherited, unexercised

### P4 — Copy and hash-verify; never re-implement from prose
**Implements:** P4
**Origin:** SPEC.md §3 (method)
**Status here:** inherited, unexercised

### P5 — Close gaps by addition, never modification
**Implements:** P5
**Origin:** SPEC.md §3 (method)
**Status here:** inherited, unexercised

### P6 — Absence must not render as a value
**Implements:** P6
**Origin:** SPEC.md §3 (method)
**Status here:** inherited, unexercised

**Origin:** SPEC.md §3 (method)
**Status here:** inherited, unexercised

# Runbook — target layer

Everything below is specific to **rosco-r2**. It is *earned, not written in
advance*: add an entry when something is learned, never in anticipation.

This layer is expected to change constantly. The invariant layer above is not —
editing it changes `invariant_hash`, which the Driver reads as a proposed
amendment to the method itself.

## Commands

Each entry below was RUN, in the `vit-dev` container, on 2026-08-10, and records
what happened -- not what documentation says should happen. `TODO` means nobody
has executed it yet.

The container mounts `~/Artifacts/vit_translation` at `/workspace`, so this tree
is `/workspace/ROSCO-r2`.

- **Build:** WORKS.
  ```
  docker exec vit-dev bash -lc "cd /workspace/ROSCO-r2/rosco/controller && \
      mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && \
      cmake --build . -j4"
  cp rosco/controller/build/libdiscon.so rosco/lib/libdiscon.so
  ```
  Pristine Fortran at `974290e` builds clean; `libdiscon.so` is 810,776 bytes.

- **Gate:** CARRIED IN, PARTIALLY WORKING -- see the blocker below.
  ```
  docker exec vit-dev bash -lc "cd /workspace/ROSCO-r2 && \
      python3 Examples/vit_sim.py --scenario N --output-dir <dir>"
  ```
  `Examples/vit_sim.py` and `scripts/regress.sh` are NOT in upstream ROSCO at
  this commit. They were copied from the previous replication's setup commit
  `bf25e35` and hash-verified (`6e6b2623446d`, `c87a74e194d0`). Each scenario
  must run in its own process -- the DLL holds SAVE state across calls.

  `regress.sh` prints `channels compared: N  mismatched: M` and writes no
  artifact. Superseded for gating by `scripts/gate.py` below; still the way to
  regenerate baselines (`bash scripts/regress.sh --baseline`).

- **Gate (use this one):** WORKS, 2026-08-10.
  ```
  python3.12 scripts/gate.py <unit>          # -> gate/<unit>.json, exit != 0 on mismatch
  ```
  Runs all 27 scenarios, compares every channel against `baseline_arrays` on
  the exact bit pattern, prints the count next to the verdict and PERSISTS it.
  Measured on the pristine build: **5,252,000 values across 351 channels, 0
  mismatched, 55 s.**

  Three things it does that `regress.sh` does not, each because of something
  observed here rather than anticipated:

  1. **It counts VALUES, not channels.** 351 against 5,252,000. P9 only asserts
     `compared > 0`, so a channel-counted artifact passes while saying four
     orders of magnitude less than it appears to -- and would not be evidence
     about the same instrument E3.2 observed failing, since the red test is
     recorded in values.
  2. **It compares bit patterns via a uint8 view, not `==`.** `==` calls two
     identical NaNs different; `np.array_equal` collapses a whole channel to one
     bool.
  3. **It restores `Examples/DISCON*.IN` afterwards.** `vit_sim.py`'s
     `write_discon()` rewrites those files in place per scenario and never puts
     them back -- measured here as `IPC_ControlMode` 1->2 and `F_NumNotchFilts`
     0->1 left in the tree. `loop/done.py` runs `require_clean_tree=True`, so a
     unit session that ran the gate could not close; a session that resolved the
     dirt with `git add -A` would commit a silently reconfigured gate for every
     unit after it. `gate.py` snapshots and restores them, records which it put
     back in `inputs_restored`, and reports anything still dirty in
     `residual_dirt` rather than assuming its own list is complete.

  Exiting non-zero when it compares NOTHING is not part of E3.1 as written. It
  follows from SPEC §7's reasoning that the count is what catches the vacuous
  case; recorded in DECISIONS.md as a local decision.

- **Baseline capture:** 26 of 27 scenarios. Scenario 4 does not run -- below.

- **Red-test the gate:** DONE 2026-08-10, and it took two attempts. Perturb a
  line, rebuild, re-run, compare against `baseline_arrays`, revert, re-run.

    attempt 1  `RootMOOPF(K) = rootMOOP(K)` (the ELSE branch) x 1.000001
               ->  624,000 compared, 0 differ.  NOT a gate failure: scenarios
                   1/4/6 do not take that branch, so the line was never run.
    attempt 2  `LPFilter = 1.0/...` -> `1.000001_DbKi/...`
               ->  624,000 compared, 198,892 differ across all 3 scenarios. RED.
    revert     ->  624,000 compared, 0 differ. GREEN restored.

  **The first attempt is the lesson.** A red test that picks an unexercised line
  produces a green and proves nothing -- it looks exactly like a gate that
  cannot fail. Perturb something the scenarios certainly reach (`LPFilter` runs
  many times per timestep in every scenario) and confirm green returns after the
  revert, or the red is not attributable to the perturbation.

- **Extract / capture:** RUNS, BUT CAPTURES NO STATE. Do not treat as working.
  ```
  docker exec vit-dev bash -lc "cd /workspace/ROSCO-r2 && \
      vit extract AddToList --file rosco/controller/src/ROSCO_IO.f90 --line 1126 \
      --run-args ' --scenario 3'"
  ```
  Run three times on 2026-08-10. Every time it printed **`✓ Extraction
  successful`** and, two lines later, **`WARNING: No state data captured.`** The
  kernel tree under `kernel/AddToList/` is generated (20 files) and contains
  **zero** files matching the campaign's state pattern `\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+$`.
  The first replication has `kernel/AddToList.0.0.1`, so this IS capturable and
  something here is not right yet.

  What was ruled out, so nobody repeats it:
  - *The call site is unreachable in the default scenario.* True but not the
    whole story -- all five `AddToList` call sites are gated on `CC_Mode`/
    `StC_Mode`. Re-running against scenario 3 (`CC_Mode=1`) changed nothing.
  - *`--run-args` not reaching KGen.* It does: `--dry-run` shows
    `--cmd-run '... vit_sim.py  --scenario 3'` and `--invocation 0:0:1-20`.
  - *The uninstrumented library being loaded* -- VIT warns about this loudly
    because the editable `ROSCO` install points at another tree. It is NOT the
    cause: `nm -D` shows 27 kgen symbols in BOTH
    `rosco/controller/build/libdiscon.so` and the installed
    `rosco/lib/libdiscon.so`. `Examples/vit_sim.py` already resolves the library
    from this tree and raises rather than falling back, with a comment naming
    this as "the one failure mode that produces a green result and no signal".
  - `VIT_WRAPPER_LOG=<path>` enables the wrapper's own diagnostics (VIT's
    authors anticipated silent capture failure). It logs a clean cmake
    reconfigure, exit 0, and stops there.

  **The point worth keeping is the shape, not the diagnosis.** A tool that
  reports success and captures nothing is the exact failure this campaign
  exists to remove, and it is sitting in our own front-end. Until this is
  understood, kernel replay is NOT available as a verification route and units
  must close on the generated harness instead.

  **Extraction is not read-only.** Each run strips CRLF from
  `rosco/controller/src/DISCON.F90` (162 lines, content identical, 7956 -> 7794
  bytes) -- including under `--dry-run` -- and leaves `include.ini`,
  `strace.log`, `kgen.log`, `model/`, `elapsedtime/` and `.vit_build_wrapper.sh`
  behind. Those are now gitignored; DISCON.F90 must be checked out afterwards.
  Note the launcher's `--protect 'rosco/controller/src/*.f90'` does NOT cover
  `DISCON.F90` -- lowercase glob, uppercase extension, verified by running
  `Path.glob` against the tree: 11 files matched, DISCON.F90 not among them.
  Add `--protect 'rosco/controller/src/*.F90'` as well.

- **Reset to clean source:** STILL TODO, and now known to be needed EARLIER
  than "once the first unit is integrated". `vit extract` installs an
  INSTRUMENTED `libdiscon.so` into `rosco/lib/` -- 27 kgen symbols, confirmed
  with `nm -D` -- and leaves it there. Any gate run after an extraction
  therefore measures the instrumented build unless the tree is rebuilt clean
  first. Until a script exists, the manual sequence is:
  ```
  git checkout -- rosco/controller/src/DISCON.F90
  docker exec vit-dev bash -lc "cd /workspace/ROSCO-r2/rosco/controller/build && \
      cmake --build . -j4 && cp libdiscon.so /workspace/ROSCO-r2/rosco/lib/libdiscon.so"
  python3.12 scripts/gate.py __gate__     # confirm 5,252,000 / 0 before trusting anything
  ```

### Two upstream ROSCO bugs must be fixed before the gate can run

Scenario 4 (`Flp_Mode=2`) segfaulted on the pristine build -- exit 139, core
dumped, reproducible. Both causes are **defects in upstream ROSCO**, not in the
harness or this setup, and both were fixed here on 2026-08-10:

1. **`Filters.f90`, `PreFilterMeasuredSignals`** -- the `Flp_Mode==2` branch
   indexes `CntrPar%F_GenSpdNotch_Ind(n)` with a loop counter `n` left over from
   an earlier `DO n = 1,CntrPar%F_GenSpdNotch_N`. With `F_GenSpdNotch_N=0` that
   loop never runs and `n` is never assigned, so the index reads undefined
   memory. Fix: wrap the NotchFilter call in the same loop, which is skipped
   when there are no notch filters.

2. **`Controllers.f90`, `FlapControl`** -- the `Flp_Mode==2` initialisation
   block (`iStatus==0`) indexes `LocalVar%Flp_Angle(K)` with an unassigned local
   `K`. The steady-state block a few lines below loops `DO K = 1,LocalVar%NumBl`
   correctly. Fix: the same loop around the initialisation call.

Both were introduced in ROSCO v2.9.0 and are documented in the previous
campaign's `ROSCO_BUG_REPORT.md`. `Flp_Mode=2` appears to be exercised by no
test in the ROSCO repository, which is why they survived.

After both fixes, `--scenario 4` exits 0 and the full baseline captures 27/27.

**Two things worth keeping from how this was found.** Two candidate fixes
carried from the previous campaign were tried FIRST and neither helped -- the
FITPACK stack scrubber, and raising `avr_size` from 500 to 3000. Carrying a fix
across because it is nearby is not the same as diagnosing. And the real cause
was already written down in the previous campaign's own bug report; reading it
would have been faster than reproducing it.

## Finishing a unit

1. Red-test the gate for this unit; confirm it fails and writes its artifact.
2. Run the gate. Non-zero compared count, zero mismatched.
3. If this unit needed a purpose-built harness, **re-run it against the
   integrated build**, not only against the translation, and commit the result.
4. Set `disposition` and `evidence` in `plan.json`. Evidence must name artifacts
   that exist.
5. Commit the translation and its gate artifacts.
6. Commit `STATUS.md`, `DECISIONS.md` and `plan.json` brought current. That
   second commit is the hand-off.
