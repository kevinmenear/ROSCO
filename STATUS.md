# STATUS — rosco-r2

**This is the live state file. Read it first, then `RUNBOOK.md`.**
`DECISIONS.md` is the append-only record of *why*; this file is *where things
stand*. One copy of every count — do not duplicate them anywhere else.

**As of 2026-08-10: unit #2 `ColemanTransform` is integrated and CLOSED — the
done-condition was run, not asserted.** `scripts/done_check.py ColemanTransform`
returns COMPLETE, 13 of 13. It took two passes: the first recorded
`disposition: integrated` while the condition stood at 10 of 13, because nothing
in the session could evaluate it. That script now exists; run it before setting
any disposition.

Closing it required opening and closing E1.2 (see Evidenced), which invalidated
and replaced the baselines. Next: the lowest-order remaining unit in
`plan.json`. Confirm it against `plan.json` before starting, including its
`phase` and `proposed_verification` fields — those are hypotheses, not facts.
**`AddToList` is order 1 and must not be dispatched — see Open.**

## Counts

1 attempted / 1 integrated / 0 integrated_unexercised / 0 out_of_scope /
0 deferred / 0 blocked.

69 units in `plan.json`; 68 remain.

## Evidenced

- **E1.2** — `rosco/controller/CMakeLists.txt` passes `-ffp-contract=off` to
  gfortran and to g++, and `scripts/assert_fp_contract.sh` asserts both the
  build line and **zero FMA instructions in the linked library**. Red-tested by
  blanking the flag: 0 build lines, 103 FMA, exit 1.
- **E3.1** — `scripts/gate.py` runs 27 scenarios, compares 5,252,000 values
  across 351 channels bit-for-bit against `baseline_arrays`, prints the count
  and persists `gate/__gate__.json`. Exits non-zero on mismatch and on comparing
  nothing.
- **E3.2** — gate observed red: perturbing `LPFilter`'s leading `1.0` moved
  1,604,573 of 5,252,000 values across 138 of 351 channels; reverting restored
  0. `gate/__gate__.redtest.json`.
- **E3.5** — `baseline_arrays/` regenerated from clean pre-integration source
  after E1.2 changed the flags; 20 of 27 scenario files moved. E3.2 re-run
  against the new set, so the red and green evidence describe the same
  baselines.

Both E3.1 and E3.2 were red-tested **as criteria**, not just satisfied:
corrupting the expected values in `phases.toml` turns them `[FAIL]`, restoring
them turns them `[ok]`.

### ColemanTransform, second pass — every number re-measured

Every artifact for this unit now comes from ONE instrument pair, VIT `d07a716`
and loop `ebce989`, and each names its own producer in a `vit_rev`/`loop_rev`
field. The first pass used VIT `d85b33b` and loop `3c88913`.

| layer | result | red-tested |
|---|---|---|
| kernel replay, 63 cases, scenario 27 | 63/63, 14,175 fields IDENTICAL | zero-writing stub → 124 `OUT_TOL`; green restored on revert |
| differential harness vs clean Fortran | 199 checked, 0 failed | mutation, below |
| mutation score | 35/35 killed, 1.000 (33 by case mismatch, 2 by failing to compile) | baseline green first, else it refuses to score |
| post-integration harness (wrapper only) | 199 checked, 0 failed | wrapper args swapped → 199/199 failed; green restored on revert |
| gate, 27 scenarios | 5,252,000 values / 351 channels, 0 mismatched | `2.0/3.0` → `2.000001/3.0` moved 124,353 values across 15 channels; revert → 0 |

`vit integrate` under the new VIT regenerated `Functions.f90`, `CMakeLists.txt`
and `colemantransform.cpp` **byte-identical** to the committed integration.

## Open

- **`AddToList` is unit #1 and its signature cannot cross the bridge.**
  `bridge_feasible: no`. `next_unit` selects on `disposition` alone and does not
  consult the field, so the Driver would still dispatch it. Decide the policy
  (skip / escalate / pre-dispose). **Additionally it is now known to be DEAD in
  the gate**: all five `AddToList` call sites have zero hits in all 27
  scenarios (`coverage/line_coverage.json`). Whatever policy is chosen, it
  cannot be verified by this gate.
- **THREE SCENARIOS EXECUTE NO CONTROLLER CODE AT ALL.** Scenarios 10, 14 and
  24 run 0 lines of Controllers.f90, ControllerBlocks.f90, Filters.f90 and
  Functions.f90; scenario 13 runs 12 lines of Functions.f90 and 0 of
  Controllers.f90. They enter DISCON, read parameters, and stop —
  DISCON.F90 42%, ReadSetParameters 39%, everything downstream 0%. Scenario 14
  reports `PASSED` and 11 of its 13 channels are a single constant. They
  contribute their values to the gate's 5,252,000 while constraining nothing
  about the controller. This is **E3.3's exact failure mode** and E3.3 is still
  `manual`. Measured, not inferred: `coverage/line_coverage.json`.
- **E2.3 is not closed by `coverage/line_coverage.json`.** That file is real
  per-scenario line coverage and it is what C2 now selects call sites from, but
  it comes from a `--coverage -O0` build, not the campaign's Release build. The
  criterion asks for coverage from a clean build committed as phase evidence.
- **The launcher's protect glob has a hole.** `rosco/controller/src/*.f90`
  matches 11 files and NOT `DISCON.F90` — the one file `vit extract` modifies
  (strips CRLF, even under `--dry-run`). Add
  `--protect 'rosco/controller/src/*.F90'`.
- **`vit verify` and `vit integrate` rewrite `vit.yaml` and strip every
  comment.** The file is declared `derive` and its provenance lives in those
  comments; three runs deleted it three times. Currently restored by hand after
  each unit. Either VIT should round-trip comments or the provenance should live
  somewhere VIT does not write.
- **`regress.sh --baseline` does not restore `Examples/DISCON*.IN`.** Only
  `gate.py` snapshots and restores them. A baseline regeneration leaves two
  files modified and the tree dirty, which blocks `done.py`'s clean-tree check.
- **The harness Makefile's LIBS can carry `kgen_utils.f90.o`**, an object that
  exists only because an extraction left it in the build tree. A from-scratch
  build directory would not have it and the link would fail.
- **`reset_to_clean.sh` leaves `CMakeLists.txt` integrated.** It restores the
  Fortran body but not the build's source list, so the tree it produces is a
  hybrid: clean Fortran plus a compiled `<stem>.cpp.o` of the same function.
  That object is a second definition of what the differential harness compiles
  itself, and the pre-integration harness link fails on it. Worked around in
  `scripts/harness.sh` (it drops this unit's own object from LIBS, and only its
  own). The alternative — have `reset_to_clean.sh` revert CMakeLists too, so
  "clean" means the pre-integration BUILD and not just the pre-integration
  SOURCE — is the better fix and is not made here: that script is red-tested and
  unit #2's second pass is not the place to re-open it. Decide before unit #3.
- `vit.yaml` is declared `derive` with `red_tested = false`. The planned test is
  to drop `assumed_size_arrays.avrSWAP` and confirm extraction breaks.
- Bootstrap otherwise incomplete: `phases.toml` still declares most criteria
  `manual`, which is NOT_EVALUABLE and never a pass.

## Closed

- **`ColemanTransform`'s closure was asserted; now it is measured.**
  `scripts/done_check.py` runs the loop's own `DoneVerifier` with exactly the
  configuration `run_campaign.py` builds. At the start of the second pass it
  returned INCOMPLETE 10/13; it now returns COMPLETE 13/13. The failing
  predicate was P12: `vit_mutate.py` wrote `total`/`equivalent` and P12 reads
  `mutants`/`equivalent_declared`, so a genuine 35/35 was invisible to the check
  that requires one — and it failed with the WRONG REASON, "the operator set
  reached nothing in this unit". Fixed in the loop repo (`13265e7`, both
  spellings emitted) and the artifact regenerated by the tool, not hand-edited.
- **Three defects in this campaign's own scripts, each found by a run that
  should have worked.** All three were invisible while the stale artifacts sat
  on disk looking like results. See DECISIONS.md.
  1. `harness.sh` failed on VIT `d07a716`'s per-unit test directory — the skew
     it existed to reconcile had closed.
  2. Its post-integration LIBS extraction passed the literal words `LIBS` and
     `+=` to the linker, because the new VIT's Makefile has a second `LIBS +=`
     assignment its `^LIBS =` grep could not see. It now asks `make`.
  3. It aborted one line before stamping whenever `./test` exited non-zero — so
     the RED artifact, the one that most needs to say what it measured, was the
     only one that could not.

- **The extraction blocker was a dead call site, not a tool defect.**
  `vit extract` printed `✓ Extraction successful` and `WARNING: No state data
  captured.` for `AddToList` three times. It was aimed at
  `ROSCO_IO.f90:1126`, which coverage now shows has **zero hits in all 27
  scenarios** — as do all five `AddToList` call sites. Pointed at a call site
  that executes, extraction works: `ColemanTransform` at `Controllers.f90:510`
  captured 63 state files, and kernel replay is available as a verification
  route. The tool was reporting success about instrumentation it had genuinely
  installed; the run never reached the pragma.
- **E1.2, previously "declared but unmet".** Closed 2026-08-10 — see Evidenced.
- **Reset-to-clean**, which did not exist: `scripts/reset_to_clean.sh` and
  `scripts/restore_integrated.sh`, red-tested.
